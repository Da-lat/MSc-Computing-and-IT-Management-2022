# MSc-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Work experience I have created throughout my Masters

Coursework 1 is analysing and interpreting what I considered a 'good' visualisation using historic literatures and experts opinions, you can find this in the pdf named "CW1Visualisation_analysis" with references in "referencesCW1.pdf"



Coursework 2 is displayed in the Jupyter notebook (Hvplot_volcanoes) using Hvplot to display my visualisation and pandas to explore the data.
The main dataset describes volcanoes worldwide alongside their eruptions, locations and types. My goal was to display how threatening volcanic eruptions were to the nearest population and show which countries have experiences the most eruptions over the last 1000 years.

My critique and reflection of my work is included under Data_Vis_CW2_analysis.
